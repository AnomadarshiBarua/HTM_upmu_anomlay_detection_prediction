# HTM_upmu_anomaly_detection_prediction

Real-time anomaly detection and simultaneous data prediction on micro-phasor measurement unit ($\mu$PMU) data in smart grid are challenging because the data are generated in a sequence and so for learning in real-time the learning has to be {\it one-pass, continuous, unsupervised, and be able to adapt to changing statistics of the online data}. Here, a neuro-cognitive inspired architecture based on Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is proposed for anomaly detection and simultaneous data prediction in smart grid $\mu$PMU data. The key technical idea is that the HTM learns a {\it sparse distributed temporal representation} of sequential data that turns out to be very useful for both anomaly detection and data prediction in real-time.

Our results show that the proposed HTM can predict anomalies with 96\%, 96\%, and 98\% accuracy for three different application profiles, namely, \textit{Standard, Reward Few False Positive, Reward Few False Negative}, respectively. We show that the HTM is competitive to five state-of-the-art algorithms for anomaly detection. Moreover, for the multi-step prediction in the online setting, the same HTM achieves a low 0.0001 normalized mean square error, a low negative log-likelihood score of 1.7 and is also competitive to six state-of-the-art prediction algorithms. We demonstrate that the same HTM model can be used for \textit{both the tasks} and can learn continuously in one-pass, unsupervised fashion and adapt to changing statistics. \textit{While the other state-of-the-art algorithms are either less accurate or can be used for one of the tasks only and cannot learn in one-pass, unsupervised, in real-time and cannot adapt to changing statistics.}
